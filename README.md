# MithrixSurprise

This is a reimplementation of Nuxlar's [MithrixSurprise](https://thunderstore.io/package/Nuxlar/MithrixSurprise/) mod with some changes. If Nuxlar wishes to resume the project themselves I will deprecate this.

## Description

Anytime you buy or print anything (PurchaseInteraction) there's a small chance you'll be visited by ol boi Mitchell. Probability is configurable, base is 0.5% chance. Made this so there's always a looming threat of Mithrix getting a lil too eager and droppin in from the moon.
